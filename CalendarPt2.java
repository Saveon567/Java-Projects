//Write a program that reads in the following data, all entered on one line with at least one space separating them:
//a)	an integer representing a month
//b)	an integer representing the day of the month 
//c)	an integer representing a year
//1.	Check that the month is between 1 and 12. If itâ€™s not, print an error message and end the program.
//2.	Day cannot be 0 or less nor can it be more than 31 for all months. Print an error message if these conditions occur and end the program. If day is in the range of 0 and 31, you will still need to check other conditions as noted below in 4.
//3.	Year cannot be less than 1. Print an error message if that occurs and end the program.
