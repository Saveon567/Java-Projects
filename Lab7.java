//This is very similar to the "mapping" example we went over in class.
//Fred wants to analyze his spending habits of the past few years and has gathered information on the checks he has written from 2014 â€“ 2018. The data is in a file in the form  YYYY XXXXXX.XX where YYYY represents the year and XXXXXX.XX represents the dollar amount of the check. Because it took a while to gather the information, the data is not in year order. See the Input Data at the end of the assignment.
//After reading in the data, he wants to print a report by year of the number of checks written, the total amount spent and the average amount of the check. Also, an overall total of the five years appears after the individual data of each year. Using
//one array to store the running total of the check amounts by year,
//an array to hold the number of checks written by year
//write the Java code to read and store the data and then do the necessary computations to produce a report in the format below. Use printf to display the dollar amounts with two decimal place and right adjust all output. You can set an int variable baseYear to 2014 and subtract it from the actual year to get the correct subscript in each array.
